# Birdwatching-Page

#The Brief
For this project, your task is to take the content for the homepage of a bird watching website and add structural elements to it so it can have a page layout applied to it.

# What it needs

- A header spanning the full width of the site containing the main title for the page, the site logo, and the navigation menu. The title and logo appear side by side once styling is applied, and the navigation appears below those two items.
- A main content area containing two columns â€” a main block to contain the welcome text, and a sidebar to contain image thumbnails.
- A footer containing copyright information and credits
- Apply the provided CSS to the page by adding another <link> element just below the existing one provided at the start.

- Adding a suitable wrapper for:
  [ ] The header
  [ ] The navigation menu
  [ ] The main content
  [ ] The welcome text
  [ ] The image sidebar
  [ ] The footer

# My biggest learnings

1. How to structure a web page into columns
2. Getting a basic idea of how flex works and using this knowledge to help me resolve issues I was having with the structure.

Before this I had bits and pieces of knowledge and I can use them as their individual pieces. Putting all those pieces of knowledge together into a structured Home Page was more difficult because I struggled to see how the different pieces linked together.

Things clicking into place was very exciting!
